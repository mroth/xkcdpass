xkcd style password generator for iOS.

[SCREENSHOT]

Most just a demo project to teach myself Swift.

Based on this cartoon:

## Installation

I have an ethical problem in paying Apple :money_with_wings: just to be able to give my software away for free, so this isn't currently available on the App Store.  If you want to send donations to me towards the $99 Apple Developer "registration fee", I happily will put this on the App Store for free!

If you *do* have a valid developer certificate, you should be able to clone this repo and install locally on your device.
