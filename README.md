# xkcdpass
xkcd style password generator for iOS.

[SCREENSHOT]

Most just a demo project to teach myself Swift.

Based on this cartoon:

## Installation

I don't believe in paying Apple money just to give software away for free, so this isn't available on the App Store.  If you want to send donations to me towards the $99 Apple Developer "registration fee", I will put this on the App Store for free!

If you *do* have a valid developer certificate, you should be able to clone this repo and install locally on your device.

## License
This application is all rights reserved (for now).  I will likely put a nonrestrictive license on it like all my other software if I find a way to put it on the App Store.
